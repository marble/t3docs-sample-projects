Project with Documentation/Index.rst
==========================================

This is the recommended way to give a project documentation.

For own projects this should always work. Start with your project, create a
subfolder :file:`Documentation` with a single file
:file:`Documentation/Index.rst` and you are done.
If this file is present it is considered to be the 'master_doc' and any
README file in the root folder is not taken into account.
