==========================================
Project with a README.rst meta information
==========================================

If there is file :file:`README.rst` and there is no :file:`Documentation/Index`
the README file will be rendered.

Meta information can be provided in :file:`Documentation/Settings.cfg`.

In this case :file:`Documentation/Settings.cfg` looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: Documentation/Settings.cfg
   :language: ini
