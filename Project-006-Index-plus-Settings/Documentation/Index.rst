Project 006 with Index.rst and Settings.cfg
===========================================

This is the recommended minimal setup that really makes sense:

*  The documentation is within :file:`./Documentation/`.

*  The master_doc is :file:`./Documentation/Index.rst`, so we have at least one
   file with content.

*  File :file:`./Documenation/Settings.cfg` is present and provides meta data
   for the rendering.
